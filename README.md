# Todo App with Priority Reordering

I've built this Todo App as part of my learning from Hitesh Choudhary's YouTube channel. The original project focused on basic todo functionalities like adding, deleting, updating, and marking as completed.

## Features Added

### Priority Reordering
- Implemented automatic sorting of todos based on priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
- Priorities are indicated with color-coded circles (Red for High, Yellow for Medium, Green for Low) in the UI.
